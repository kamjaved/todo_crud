//--- INSTALLATION PROCESS OF APPLICATION 
 
STEP-1  in root folder i.e where all folder is present from client to routes or say backend code 
STEP-2 run command  npm i
STEP-3  after that goto to client folder and run the same command npm i 
STEP-4 again come to root folder and run command  npm run dev it will start both frontend and backend simultaniously 

As you have told me to upload it in any demo server. i was going to use heruku but unfortunatly free version of heroku allow to run only 5 app in a account and i have used my full quota. 

//WARNING:-  for your convenience I am leaving my mongodb database string into the project so that you already have some dummy data after installing  
             please email or call me after you check the assignment so that i can remove the db
